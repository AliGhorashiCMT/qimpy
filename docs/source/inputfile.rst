Input file documentation
========================

QimPy uses the `YAML format <https://yaml.org>`_ for input files.
See below for a complete list of settings.
Most settings have sensible defaults:
start with the :doc:`/tutorials/index` to see the most commonly used settings
and then use the following as a reference for more information on each setting.

Click on each setting to open a more detailed documentation,
and also to link to the corresponding entry in the :doc:`/api`.
In addition to settings listed below, the special keyword `include`
can be used at any level to effectively load another YAML file
into that level of the heirarchy.
